                On this occasion of the birthday of the great leader, freedom fighter, Indian lawyer, politician, social
                activist, and
                writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India, Mohandas
                Karamchand Gandhi
                (commonly known as Gandhiji), I would like to spread the word what Gandhi Itself said. ‘Don’t use the
                items made by
                British.’ You might ignore all this long content, but every line means a lot and will change your life
                and health a lot.
                Let’s look at the disadvantages of hazardous-’British-introduced'-’cheap’-’low-quality’-aluminum used by
                each of us.
                "WHAT-A-HARM”. Here we will also read about the Advantages of “Immunity causing" earthen pots and
                Copper.

                style="margin-left: 190px;">
            <p>Please Don't Use Poison-Like-Aluminum. You will be shocked to know the disadvantages of "British
                originated" aluminum
                and advantages of earthen pots. Looks like the time has come where we have to get back to our basics.

                What first comes in your mind when you hear the words “Abundant, Cheap, Strong, Durable, Light Weight,
                Versatile,
                Recyclable, Non-Breakable and Non-Corrosive. Definitely, I think its Aluminum, right?? In this
                generation, we have been
                adopting to easy life-styles and have been using items which are more convenient and easier to use. As
                aluminum is as
                easy to use, it is that hazardous to health. It is considered as health-destroyer.



                Let’s Know all about aluminum, Remember, every line matters a lot.</p>

        </div>
        <div>

            <h1 id="whydangerous">Why is Aluminum Dangerous?</h1>
            <p> Food cooked in aluminum vessels or wrapped in aluminum foil, can absorb and it can dissolve into
                food and water during
                cooking and storing processes. This absorbed aluminum goes into the bloodstream and accumulates in
                different organs in
                different people causing a multitude of effects. Some unpleasant effects of eating food cooked in
                aluminum are
                hyper-acidity, peptic ulcers, indigestion, flatulence, skin problems like pigmentation, eczema,
                dandruff and chronic
                inflammation of the intestine, which may be diagnosed or misdiagnosed as Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's
                disease or as
                chronic amoebic dysentery. Aluminum reduces growth of bones and joints. Evidence shows that at the
                time of Rama and
                Krishna (Gods), People were so huge that their height was 9 to 10 inches probably because they used
                only pots and other
                kitchenware to cook, and reports show that a person's height over the generations is gradually
                decreasing. It’s probably
                because of the changes in food techniques. If you believe mythology, according to Kalagnanam , a
                person will have to
                climb Tephrosia purpurea (VEMPALI CHETTU IN TELUGU) using ladder, which is a very short tree.
                Understand how short a
                person will be in the far future. This is probably because of the change in the food techniques of a
                man.</p>

            <h1 id="historyaluminum">History of Aluminum : -</h1>
            <p>Aluminum was brought to India by British people to weaken Indians and take control over us.

                This was because Indians were so resistant and strong that every time British tried to take control
                over us, they would
                fail. So British came with this idea of weakening Indians by introducing aluminum. By using
                aluminum, Indians became
                weaker and weaker, and British got control over us. </p>

            <h1 id="dangers">What are the dangers of Non-Stick Pans</h1>
            <p>Most non-stick cookware is made with a Teflon coating over it to enable the non-stickiness. Teflon is
                also known as
                Polytetrafluoroethylene. Because of this, heating Teflon pans on a high fire releases a substance called
                Per-fluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA or C8) which are dangerous to human health and can kill a bird kept in
                the kitchen in a
                matter of minutes! Even 5 minutes of heating a nonstick pan on a high fire can cause this problem which
                in humans is
                called polymer fume fever. “Woah! Those Many toxins”. If you are using non-stick cookware always use a
                low fire.
                Depression, worry, anxiety, memory loss, osteoporosis, eye disorders, reduction in the ability of the
                kidneys, diarrhea,
                hyperacidity, indigestion, stomachache, colitis, mouth ulcers, skin problems such as eczema etc.</p>

            <h1 id="more">More about Teflon cookware (Non-Stick)</h1>
            <p>Evidences show that the use of Teflon coated utensils, suppresses immunity and increases the risk of
                kidney cancer,
                cancers of the blood like leukemia in children. The world's largest manufacturer of Teflon and non-stick
                vessels has
                settled lawsuits out of court from people who have developed cancer and have quoted studies showing that
                Teflon does
                indeed poison the immune system. Aluminum is also known to affect the brain causing dementia and
                Alzheimer's disease.
                The first signs of its toxic effects on the brain, is loss of short-term memory. Continued exposure to
                aluminum over
                thirty to forty years may cause Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease the patient is unable to
                recollect recent
                events, but is able to clearly recollect events which occurred many years earlier. At present there is
                no effective
                treatment for this. Consuming unrefined coconut oil 1 tablespoon a day, may help this condition.</p>

            <h3>1. Helps Digestive System perform Better</h3>
            <p>Copper has properties that help kill harmful bacteria and reduce inflammation within the stomach, making
                it a great
                remedy for ulcers, indigestion and infections. Copper also helps cleanse and detox your stomach,
                regulates the working
                of your liver and kidneys, and proper elimination of waste and ensures the absorption of nutrients from
                food. When water
                is stored in a copper container, the mineral gets leached into it. This copper leached in the water
                helps in breaking
                down of food particles in our and improves our digestion.

            <h3>2. Aids weight loss
            </h3>
            <p>To lose weight quicker, try drinking water stored in a copper vessel regularly. Apart from fine tuning
                your digestive
                system to perform better, copper also helps your body break down fat and eliminates it more efficiently,
                thereby,
                helping your body keep only what it will use and throw out the rest.

            <h3>3. Helps heal wounds faster</h3>
            <p>Known for its immense anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, copper is a great tool
                for healing
                wounds quickly. Apart from that, copper is also known to strengthen your immune system and aid in the
                production of new
                cells. But its healing properties don't cease with helping the body externally.

            <h3>4. Mitigates the risk of cancer</h3>
            <p>Another disease that is quickly becoming extremely common, cancer, can be debilitating for both the
                patient and their
                family. How does copper help? Well, copper has very strong antioxidant properties that helps fight off
                free radicals and
                negate their ill effects – one of the main reasons for the development of cancer</p>

            <h3>5. Protects you from infections</h3>
            <p>Copper is known to be oligodynamic in nature (the sterilizing effect of metals on bacteria), and can
                destroy bacteria
                very effectively. It is especially effective against E. coli and S.aureus, two bacteria that are
                commonly found in our
                environment and known to cause severe illnesses in the human body.</p>

            <h3>6. Regulates the working of the thyroid gland</h3>
            <p>Health experts believe that one commonality among people with thyroid diseases is that they usually have
                low levels of
                copper in their body. While this is most commonly seen in people with hyperthyroidism (excessive thyroid
                hormone), those
                with hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone) may also suffer from this deficiency</p>
            <br>
            <hr color="006400">
            <h3>7. Beats arthritis and inflamed joints</h3>
            <p>Copper has anti-inflammatory properties. This asset is especially great to relieve aches and pains caused
                due to
                inflamed joints. It's like in the case of arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Apart from that, copper
                also has bone and
                immune system strengthening properties, making it the perfect remedy for rheumatoid arthritis.

                role for the
                well-being of a human body. Cooking in earthen pots is a slow process and involves the use of a minimum

                earthen pots
                hold lots of promise for the environment. Hence, it is highly recommended to use earthen pots while
                cooking as it has
                multiple benefits in keeping the body healthy and fit

                Back in the day, earthenware was a constant in Indian kitchens. Right from storing water to cooking,
                women managed it
                all with a single pot or ‘handi’, as it’s called in rural India. And, despite the availability of fancy
                and expensive
                cooking utensils, it looks like it’s time to go back to the basics.

                It comes with a bunch of health benefits, since it cooks the food slowly. It also scores over aluminum,
                as studies point
                out. An estimate of the health risk to consumers is very high due to the evil-”
                British-introduced”-aluminum. You could
                also check the weight of aluminum cookware when it’s purchased and after a couple of years, and you’re
                likely to spot a
                recognizable difference.

                through the food,
                thus retaining the nutritional level. In metal utensils, this tends to get lost. When cooking meats
                especially, the
                thermal inertia helps the muscle proteins denature and collagen break down completely, hence keeping it
                tender for a
                longer duration.</p>
